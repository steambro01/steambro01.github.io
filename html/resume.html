                    Hi, My name is Steven Ambrose lll and I am from the Chicagoland area. I grew up in West Englewood until high school when I moved with my aunt and attended Thornton Township High School in Harvey, IL. I currently live in Hobart, IN, which is 20 minutes from the border of Illinois. Since my 4th grade Career Day I knew that I would grow up to be an Engineer. I always loved solving problems and anything that had anything to do with math or numbers. I’ve participated in multiple different STEM gatherings when I was younger and helped my school come home with top rankings. As I got older though ( in my high school years), I started to become discouraged because I didn’t know what type of engineer I wanted to become. I’ve cycled through many different Engineering fields in my head over the last decade (electrical, mechanical, and nuclear )but the two that I was almost positive I would never find interest in were Civil and Software. Fast forward to the summer of 2021, i've been out of high school for over a year now and living on my own. I realized that college wasn’t for me around my junior year so here I am at home on youtube looking up “highest paying careers that don’t require a degree” and I kept stumbling across programming. After a bit of research I decided to try sololearn to get to know the basics. I started off with a Python course (not knowing any better) and instantly fell in love with the way I could make my thoughts come to life on a webpage. The possibilities were endless and I knew that I had finally found my calling... as a SOFTWARE ENGINEER!
